This is a disassembly of the Sonic "Crackers" Chaotix prototype, continued directly from an old 2009 disassembly by MarkeyJester. All changes starting from that point are chronicled in this repository.

THIS ISN'T "USABLE" YET. Currently it's only up for research and demonstrational purposes, and until further notice, isn't meant to serve as a workable disassembly.
